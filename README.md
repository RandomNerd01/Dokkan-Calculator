# Dokkan Defense Calculator

Instead of hardcoding a multiplier for every unit in the game(Too tedious), I used Python to search through DokkanInfo.com and search through the html file of characters. There, I then find patterns in the HTML file that automatically determine the passive and calculate the multipliers automatically. 

However, exceptions to these patterns are very common especially in characters that have more complex pasives, thus the code for a signficant amount of characters had to be different.


## Steps

1)Input Character ID from DokkanInfo (Find character from https://dokkaninfo.com/cards. Click the Card. Then Get the Character ID)

2) Follow Steps that are shown inside the command prompt.




3) All Characters have custom options based on their passives. For example, DokkanFest AGL First Form Frieza has an intro as well as defense based on number of terrifying conqueror allies on the team.

4) Gives you Final Defense Stat at the end
