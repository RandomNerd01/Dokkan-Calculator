# Dokkan Defense Calculator

Instead of hardcoding a multiplier for every unit in the game(Too tedious), I used Python to search through DokkanInfo.com and search through the html file of characters. There, I then find patterns in the HTML file that automatically determine the passive and calculate the multipliers automatically. 

However, exceptions to these patterns are very common especially in characters that have more complex pasives, thus the code for a signficant amount of characters had to be different.
