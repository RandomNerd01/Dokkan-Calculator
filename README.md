# Dokkan Defense Calculator

Instead of hardcoding a multiplier for every unit in the game(Too tedious), I used Python to search through DokkanInfo.com and search through the html file of characters. There, I then find patterns in the HTML file that automatically determine the passive and
calculates the multipliers automatically
